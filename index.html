                The pricetag for President Trump's border wall has topped $11 billion — or nearly $20 million a mile — to become the
                most expensive wall of its kind anywhere in the world. In a status report last week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is overseeing wall construction, reported that
                $11 billion has been identified since Trump took office to construct 576 miles of a new "border wall system."
                And the Trump administration is on the hunt for funding to build even more. The Department of Homeland Security has
                asked the Defense Department to come up with money for 270 additional miles of border wall that DHS says is needed to
                block drug smuggling routes on federal land. The Pentagon is studying the request, which did not come with a dollar
                figure. President Trump announced to end plans on building a wall around the US - Mexico boarder and decided that
                chicken coop fencing would be a suitable replacement. Rough estimates put the costs at a fraction of the price of
                the wall. Trump's border wall is now the tallest and most expensive in the world, said Reece Jones, a geographer at the University
                of Hawaii who studies border walls.
                "The cost of almost $20 million per mile cost is four times as much as the most expensive other walls being built,"
                Jones said.
                Border walls are much in vogue in the post-Cold War era, he said, and there are now at least 60 around the world.
                Israel's wall on the West Bank ranks as the second most expensive — at a paltry $1 million to $5 million a mile.
                Congress appropriated funds to build the wall in the Rio Grande Valley, but the government now says it needs more. CBP
                is dipping into $600 million of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which holds money seized in criminal investigations.
                Some of the extra money will be used to build the wall higher and 10 miles longer. There have also been "increased
                project costs due to unforeseen site conditions" — to wit, serious seepage problems where the levee wall crosses a canal
                that empties into the Rio Grande.

                The Digital Dollar Project aims to encourage the launch of a central bank digital currency in the United States,
                according to Giancarlo, who is currently one of the founders of the project.
                “We seek to encourage the next major innovation in [United States] currency: a tokenized fiat currency issued by the
                Federal Reserve System,” said Giancarlo. “A new digital form of the dollar that, alongside traditional fiat coins, bank
                notes, and reserves, would enjoy the full faith and credit of the U.S. government as central bank money.”
                Giancarlo’s comments come at a time when the European, Japanese, and Canadian central banks are grouping to study the
                prospects of launching virtual currencies in their countries individually.
                The Digital Dollar Project was announced last week as a partnership between consultancy company Accenture and the
                Digital Dollar Foundation (DDF).
                The other founders of the DDF include another former CFTC official Daniel Gorfine and Pure Storage CEO Charles
                Giancarlo, who is also a former Cisco Systems executive.
                Previously, the founders of the initiative revealed some details about the project in two separate articles published by
                The Wall Street journal. However, none of them has explicitly talked about a CBDC.
                Opposed to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or stablecoins like Tether (USDT), a central bank digital currency or
                CBDC is the digital form of fiat money that is issued by the state and has legal tender status approved by the
                government. Some parts of the U.S. government have already been exploring the potential launch of a CBDC to date.
                In the recently posted remarks, Giancarlo clearly says that the Digital Dollar initiative will “develop a framework for
                potential, practical steps that can be taken to establish a dollar CBDC.” His planned remarks read:

                Snapchat and NBC Olympics are again teaming up to produce customized Olympics content for users in the U.S. — this time,
                for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics this summer. The companies had previously worked together during the Rio 2016 and
                PyeongChang 2018 Olympics. The PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games in 2018 reached over 40 million U.S. users, up 25% from
                the 2016 Rio Olympics.In addition, 95% of those users were under the age of 35.
                This younger demographic is getting harder to reach in the cord-cutting era, as many people forgo pay-TV subscriptions
                and traditional broadcast networks in favor of on-demand streaming services, like Netflix. That limits the reach of
                advertisers, impacting NBC’s bottom line.
                The Snap partnership helps to fix that, as it offers NBC Olympics a way to sell to advertisers who want to reach younger
                fans who don’t watch as much — or any — TV. Snapchat today reaches 90% of all 13 to 24-year-olds in the U.S., and 75% of
                all 13 to 34-year-olds; 210 million people now use Snapchat daily.

                Xbox Series X is the next-generation Xbox, releasing in late 2020. Previously known by its codename 'Xbox Project
                Scarlett', the Xbox Series X was officially revealed at The Game Awards 2019 with a trailer that showed off the next
                Xbox in all its glory.
                We now know when the next Xbox will release, its official name, a few of the specs on offer, and what it's going to look
                like. Xbox Series X will be a bit of a departure both design-wise and name-wise from its predecessors, sporting a
                blockier style that's similar to that of a small gaming PC - with an upright tower design. And, more importantly, the
                specs Microsoft has revealed so far suggest its going to be an absolute powerhouse.
                But Xbox Series X will not be the only next-generation hardware on offer from Microsoft. The company has confirmed that
                the family of consoles will be called 'Xbox' and that 'Series X' is just one of the consoles within that family.

                As Nike celebrates 30 years of the Air Max 90 throughout 2020 — from recrafting the iconic silhouette to introducing
                FlyEase into the Air Max 90 family — the Air Max 2090 is the company’s current shoe of the future.
                Leveraging the same DNA that made the Air Max 90 so iconic and future-forward 30 years ago, the Air Max 2090 is designed
                to illustrate what the future holds. Color Blocking: Color blocking was instrumental in the development of the original Air Max 90, with darker colors
                underscoring the strength in the shoe’s support structure. In that same vein, the 2090 relays this through levels of
                opacity — the most supportive materials are 100 percent opaque, and the least supportive (and lighter weight) materials
                are see-through.
                Air Unit: With the aim of all-day comfort, the Air Max 2090 employs a larger Air unit than its originator, with a 200
                percent larger window than traditional side-visibility Air units seen 30 years ago.
                Cropped Swoosh: The iconic Nike Swoosh was first cropped below on the Air Max 90, and the Swoosh of Air Max 2090 —
                though updated — follows the same design ethos.
                Flexibility: Echoing the Air Max 90's waffle outsole, the Air Max 2090 also employs distinct grooves for flexibility and
                takes original tread lines and updates the pattern for performance in 2020.
                Air Max 90 Mudguard: One of the three key elements voted upon by Air Max 90 wearers, the Air Max 2090 mudguard remains
                untouched from the original.
                Air Max 90 Cassette: This design element, which surrounds and highlights the Air unit, is iconically featured in the
                shoe's original design and was a must-keep element in the Air Max 2090.
                Air Max 90 Heel Logo: The classic heel logo first employed by the Air Max 90 is reflected in the Air Max 2090 update —
                look closely and you can see the new "Air" logo.
                The Air Max 2090 launch colorways are, in part, inspired by the future of transportation — an ode to the original Air
                Max 90’s inspiration drawing from Italian sports cars.
                The Nike Air Max 2090 releases globally this spring.

            <p class="newspaper newspaper6">
                Question from Jane: 
                I recently left my home town and moved across the country, as did some of my close friends. Now that I have friends
                scattered across the country I am nervous that my friendships will not remain as strong over time. What advice would you
                have to keep a strong bond with your friends when living so far apart?
            </p>

            <p>
                Answer from Sally: 
                This can be really difficult. Luckily, we have this great thing called social media. This being said, I know it's not
                the same as face-to-face communication. These friendships are obviously important for you to maintain. Scattering all
                around the country and being hundreds of miles apart is really difficult for anyone. Just try and remember that everyone
                feels the same as you. Everyone in your circle that has also moved feels the same way. You can talk to them about your
                feelings. Try and stay connected over social media or maybe have weekly calls with your friends to stay caught up.
                You're also going to meet new people. Not saying to throw away these long-seeded friendships, but don't lose sight and
                put new relationships on the back burner because you're trying to keep up with the old. If you can visit your friends,
                do that! It can be awesome to plan a weekend trip to see your friends, it gives you something to work toward and look
                forward to! Just make sure to maintain and nurture these relationships that are so important. It's like you're still
                together, except it will be through a screen mostly. This can be really hard, but people do drift apart and distance can
                make these powerful bonds stronger.
