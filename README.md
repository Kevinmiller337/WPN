This was a class project for web application class. This project uses html, css, javascript, php and sql. Xampp was used to test the site locally. There were strick rules that I had to follow when creating this site such as using vanilla css and javascript. As well as using inline javascript. This assignment also required that student create 5 seperate web forms on different pages. The site is not very responsive and I look to rewrite the entire project in the future.
